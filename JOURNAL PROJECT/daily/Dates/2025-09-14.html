        <h2>A day in my life</h2>
        <div class="card-container">
            <div class="content-card">I woke up at 1:32 AM after a vivid dream where I was living with my primary school friend Rasaq and his mom. My presence seemed unnoticed. My aunty Maureen came into the dream and brought bread, which turned into drugs, waking me up. The voice of Ngozi still felt strong, while Iya-the-thief appeared pressured and afraid.</div>
            <div class="content-card">During morning prayer and worship, the voices tried to distract and confuse me, but I remained focused and opened my heart to God. A message and a worship video from my Christian community reinforced my faith, surprising Iya-the-thief and silencing all the voices.</div>
            <div class="content-card">At church service, the spirits attempted attacks through discussion, criticism, praise, insults, advice, and manipulation to implant pride in my mind. I saved my journal on my HTML site, remaining undisturbed despite their interference.</div>
            <div class="content-card">Later, I received a signal to watch a movie. Iya-the-thief tried to intercept, but I followed the guidance without resisting emotions, observing their reactions. I slept and dreamt the voices acknowledged they would be fine as long as I maintained my breathing and focus.</div>
        </div>

    <section class="daily-section">
        <h2>Observations</h2>
        <div class="card-container">
            <div class="content-card">Attacks through words, feelings, and intuition did not prevail when I released control and trusted God; they bounced back.</div>
            <div class="content-card">The spirits intercept, read, and mimic signals from my mind, aiming to make me think they control me.</div>
            <div class="content-card">I consistently feel God’s presence directing me, especially when I stop trying to control outcomes.</div>
            <div class="content-card">The spirits attempt to predict God’s thoughts and influence my beliefs, but ignoring them renders their attacks ineffective.</div>
            <div class="content-card">When I stay silent and observe, the voices analyze my mind like thieves, discussing and predicting my usual responses.</div>
            <div class="content-card">Key lesson: They often pretend ignorance, acting unaware of what is happening, but their actions reveal their intentions.</div>

        <h2>Wins</h2>

            <div class="content-card">Remained focused on worship and prayer despite distraction and manipulation from the voices.</div>
            <div class="content-card">Saved my journal successfully on my HTML site while resisting spiritual attacks.</div>
            <div class="content-card">Followed spiritual guidance for watching the movie without giving in to fear or control from the spirits.</div>

        <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
        <div class="card-container">
            <div class="content-card">Releasing control and trusting God allows attacks from spirits to bounce back without effect.</div>
            <div class="content-card">Observing quietly and paying attention to patterns in their behavior provides insight into their strategies.</div>
            <div class="content-card">God’s presence is real and protective when I surrender control and maintain focus on Him.</div>

            <div class="content-card">
                Lord, thank You for Your guidance and protection today. Teach me to trust You fully, release control, and remain observant of deception. Strengthen me to overcome manipulation and to stay focused on Your presence in all circumstances. Amen.

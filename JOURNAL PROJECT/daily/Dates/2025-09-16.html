        <h2>A day in my life</h2>
        <div class="card-container">
            <div class="content-card">I woke up at 4:45 AM after a dream where my father and I were ostracized due to a tragic event. A foreign man narrated his regretful experience of coming to Nigeria unsuccessfully. I also saw myself in secondary school moving between classes by boat.</div>
            <div class="content-card">I decided to start watching movies after a period of being spiritual to study the voices, but they opposed me through strategies and verbal manipulation, trying to convince me I was normal and not spiritual.</div>
            <div class="content-card">I sang worship to God, read Psalms, and made morning prayer declarations. I created a website to document my experiences with God and the demonic spirits. The voices tried to coerce me into writing false testimonies for personal gain, but I refused and rebuked them in Jesus' name.</div>
            <div class="content-card">They threatened me and attempted to manipulate my words, but the power of God prevented them from stealing or influencing anything belonging to my family. I also resisted contact from an old friend connected to drugs and did not watch porn today.</div>

        <h2>Observations</h2>
        <div class="card-container">
            <div class="content-card">They always oppose my decisions and attempt to prevent me from journaling or observing them.</div>
            <div class="content-card">They offer praise, money, or other incentives to influence me but remain hidden and try to sneak thoughts into my mind.</div>
            <div class="content-card">They discourage me, argue among themselves, and constantly remind themselves they aim to overpower me, though I feel I am dominating them and reducing their power.</div>

    <section class="daily-section">
        <h2>Wins</h2>
        <div class="card-container">
            <div class="content-card">Created a website documenting spiritual experiences without succumbing to manipulation.</div>
            <div class="content-card">Resisted threats, manipulation, and temptation from spirits and an old friend connected to drugs.</div>
            <div class="content-card">Did not watch porn and maintained spiritual focus throughout the day.</div>

        <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
        <div class="card-container">
            <div class="content-card">They will oppose my decisions and try to distract or manipulate me, but discernment and faith allow me to remain in control.</div>
            <div class="content-card">Refusing to participate in their schemes and rebuking in Jesus’ name is effective protection.</div>
            <div class="content-card">Journaling, observing patterns, and documenting spiritual experiences strengthen awareness and spiritual authority.</div>

                Lord, thank You for guiding me and protecting me from manipulation and deception today. Help me stay focused on You, strengthen my boundaries, and continue to observe and learn from every experience. Amen.

        <h2>A day in my life</h2>
        <div class="card-container">
            <div class="content-card">I dreamt there was an earthquake and many people died. Chaos filled my secondary school, Aquinas College. After the earthquake, a deadly infection spread among the students, killing anyone who got infected. The police arrested anyone in school uniform, so I hid in a barbershop. One of the thugs who worked with the police came in, saw me, and whispered, “Go back, don’t go outside—they’ll catch you.” Then I woke up.</div>
            <div class="content-card">I remembered having a similar dream some days ago where another disaster happened in my secondary school. After waking up, I prayed and began studying. My day was filled with reading the Word of God and reflection from 8 AM till night.</div>

        <h2>Observations</h2>
        <div class="card-container">
            <div class="content-card">The voices seem to be drawing back—they don’t attack like before. It feels like they’re holding back, possibly because I’m paying attention and journaling about them.</div>
            <div class="content-card">They try to make me believe they are still in charge, but I sense their weakness and fear. They insult me, tempt me, and make false offers, yet I keep refusing and rebuking them in Jesus’ name.</div>
            <div class="content-card">I noticed they get “hungry” often, making me feel hungry repeatedly. It’s as if they’re trying to manipulate my appetite.</div>
            <div class="content-card">They often threaten that I’ll die if I keep journaling about them, but I remain steadfast in faith and continue to write.</div>
        </div>

    <section class="daily-section">
        <h2>Wins</h2>
        <div class="card-container">
            <div class="content-card">I maintained my spiritual focus, studying and reflecting on God’s Word throughout the day.</div>
            <div class="content-card">I continued journaling boldly despite threats and fear tactics from the voices.</div>
            <div class="content-card">I stayed alert and discerning, recognizing their weakening influence and holding onto my authority in Christ.</div>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section class="daily-section">
        <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
        <div class="card-container">
            <div class="content-card">The enemy’s strength diminishes when I observe, journal, and refuse to cooperate with lies or manipulation.</div>
            <div class="content-card">Consistency in prayer and studying the Word keeps my spiritual awareness strong.</div>
            <div class="content-card">Even small acts of faith—like journaling and rebuking evil—help reveal their weakness and magnify God’s power.</div>
        </div>

    <section class="daily-section">
        <h2>Reflection & Prayer</h2>
        <div class="card-container">
            <div class="content-card">
                Lord Jesus, thank You for helping me recognize the enemy’s weakness and teaching me to stay alert in Your presence. Strengthen me to continue observing, rebuking, and journaling with boldness. Fill me with peace, courage, and wisdom as I grow in Your truth. Amen.

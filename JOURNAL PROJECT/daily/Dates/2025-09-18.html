        <div class="card-container">
            <div class="content-card">
                I dreamt there was an earthquake and many people died. There was chaos in my secondary school, Aquinas College. First came the earthquake, then a deadly infection spread among the students, killing anyone infected. The police tried to control the outbreak by arresting everyone wearing the school uniform. I hid in a barbershop, and one of the thugs who reported students’ locations to the police came in. As I was about to run out, he signaled to me and whispered, “Go back, don’t go outside—they will catch you.” Then I woke up.
            </div>
            <div class="content-card">
                I once had another dream a few days ago about a disaster happening again in my secondary school. After waking, I prayed, studied, and spent my morning reflecting. From 8 AM to 8 PM, I devoted my time to studying and meditating on the Word of God.

        <h2>Observations</h2>
        <div class="card-container">
            <div class="content-card">The voices are drawing back—they don’t attack as before. It feels like they’re holding back, possibly because I’m observing and journaling about them.</div>
            <div class="content-card">They try to make me believe they are still in charge, but I sense their weakness and fear.</div>
            <div class="content-card">They insult me, make offers for me to accept them, but I keep refusing and rebuking them in Jesus’ name.</div>
            <div class="content-card">They seem pressured and uncomfortable, pretending to be strong through small temptations and attacks.</div>
            <div class="content-card">I noticed they get hungry often, making me feel hungry repeatedly—as though trying to manipulate me to eat more.</div>
            <div class="content-card">They threaten that I’ll die if I keep journaling about them, but I will not stop.</div>

        <h2>Wins</h2>
        <div class="card-container">
            <div class="content-card">I continued journaling and documenting my experiences without fear.</div>
            <div class="content-card">I stayed consistent in studying and praying from morning till night.</div>
            <div class="content-card">I resisted all their threats, lies, and manipulations and focused on God’s Word.</div>

        <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>

            <div class="content-card">The enemy becomes weaker when I pay attention, observe, and write down what’s happening.</div>
            <div class="content-card">Discerning their tricks and rebuking in Jesus’ name breaks their influence.</div>
            <div class="content-card">Journaling strengthens awareness and makes me more spiritually alert and bold.</div>

            <div class="content-card">
                Lord Jesus, thank You for keeping me aware and strong. Thank You for revealing the enemy’s weakness and giving me peace through Your Word. Help me to remain faithful, observant, and fearless as I continue documenting these experiences with You by my side. Amen.

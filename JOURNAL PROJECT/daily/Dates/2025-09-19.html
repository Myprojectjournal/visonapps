        <h2>Dream</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>
                I dreamt I travelled to Togo. My dad dropped me at the bus station, but there was no bus remaining. A traveller in a private car offered me a lift, and I paid him. I told him I had nowhere to stay in Togo, so he promised to help me get a job and a place to stay.  
                When we arrived at night, he took me to meet a woman who was supposed to employ me. After they negotiated, I asked about the salary, and he said there would be no pay — that I would work for free. I disagreed and left the place, wandering the streets.  
                An Igbo man saw me and asked what was wrong. I told him my story, and he said that in Togo, once it’s 2 PM, everyone must go indoors, and by 11 PM, people come outside — no one is ever seen outside by 2 PM.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Then, I had another dream where I travelled to my hometown and stayed with my aunty. One of my uncle’s wives said she dreamt that someone in the family had HIV.  
                A friend borrowed money from me but couldn’t pay back even though I needed the money to travel, so I got angry and almost fought him.  
                Later, I saw one of my secondary school classmates who was happy to see me and called my name.  
                My aunty also bought a bus and called me to enter, and I did. I woke up exactly at 4:00 AM.

            <p>
                After waking up, I listened to Apostle Selman’s preaching, studied the Word, went to church for choir practice, and came back home.

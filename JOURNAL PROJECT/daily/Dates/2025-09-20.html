                I woke up by 4:00 AM but forgot my dreams. I went back to sleep and had a dream where people in a union or organization were fighting each other. One member had borrowed ₦18,000, paid ₦16,000, and refused to pay the remaining ₦2,000 or complete his assigned task. The argument escalated, and they all started fighting him. The leader of the union came to ask what was happening, and while they were explaining, another fight broke out. I was there watching but didn’t join in. Then I woke up.

            <div class="content-card">
                After morning prayers, I watched a movie, ate, and went for choir practice. When I returned, I rested and slept.

        <h2>Observations</h2>
        <div class="card-container">
            <div class="content-card">They insult me and try to make me feel less of myself.</div>
            <div class="content-card">They seem to be drawing back and not attacking as before—maybe because they don’t want me journaling or they’re losing power over me.</div>
            <div class="content-card">They talk through me and try to implant words in my mind.</div>
            <div class="content-card">They keep asking, “Where is your God?” trying to provoke doubt or discouragement.</div>
            <div class="content-card">They argue and fight among themselves—either to deceive me or because they’re truly in conflict.</div>
            <div class="content-card">They strongly resist me journaling or updating my website about them.</div>
            <div class="content-card">They fight my prayer life and constantly attempt to draw me away from God.</div>

            <div class="content-card">I continued journaling and staying aware of their tactics despite pressure.</div>
            <div class="content-card">I went to choir practice, choosing fellowship over isolation or distraction.</div>

            <div class="content-card">Consistency in journaling and observing their patterns keeps me spiritually alert.</div>
            <div class="content-card">God’s presence is my defense—even when they question, “Where is your God?” His peace remains my answer.</div>

            <div class="content-card">
                Lord, thank You for giving me awareness and strength to stand firm. When the voices try to question Your presence, remind me that You are always near. Help me remain steadfast in prayer, worship, and journaling as I grow in discernment and victory. Amen.

            <p>
                I saw myself in the middle of a T-junction where armed robbers were attacking us. Suddenly, some ladies with guns came and chased them away. Just when we thought we were safe, a gang wearing red and black appeared and ordered us to march toward the king’s palace.
            </p>
            <p>
                As we marched, a voice whispered to me, “Don’t enter that palace, they will kill you all and use you for sacrifice.” I managed to escape before reaching the palace.
                The next day, those who entered the palace were paraded around the city, meant to be used for sacrifice. People watched helplessly. Then a brave girl challenged the gang and was struck by them. She called her father, who was an army general, and he came with soldiers to rescue the people.

        <h2>Day Summary</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>
                Yesterday at church, for the first time, I wore a shirt, tie, trousers, and black shoes — a different look from my usual hip-hop style with baggy jeans and Timberlands. The voices mocked me, saying I looked like a clown. I had also stopped using the cream that made my skin fair, deciding to remain dark and natural.  
            </p>
            <p>
                They mocked me again, calling me names, but I stood firm. I decided to keep dressing modestly and burn my old street clothes. I want to look different — simple, decent, and focused on God.  
                I thought maybe the voices liked my old look, and now that I’ve changed, they’re losing interest in me. These days, they feel far away — they mostly fight among themselves, shouting, cursing, and accusing one another. They even beg me to talk and make peace with them, promising not to harm me if I align with them, but I refuse.

                <li>They fight among themselves these days.</li>
                <li>Whatever I repeatedly say or do seems to become automatic in their realm.</li>
                <li>They depend on “Baba the Thief” to bring them back to order — without him, they are confused and visionless.</li>

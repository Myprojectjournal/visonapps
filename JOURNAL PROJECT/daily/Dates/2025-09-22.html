        <h2>Dreams</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>
                I had a dream where a movie filled with intense sexual scenes was being shown, and everyone was eager to watch, but I resisted and refused to look.  
            </p>
            <p>
                I also dreamt that people complained my skin was too dark, but I didn’t care — I chose to keep my natural complexion.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Another dream showed a man whose friend cheated with his wife. When he found out, he tortured and beat the man before leaving him.

        <div class="content">
            <p>
                Baba the projector — the evil mindset the demonic voices planted in my mind — spoke today through me. He declared there was no hope for them anymore in my life and admitted that they had made a covenant never to break their plan. He said they could only operate within that plan, and as a result, God’s power would keep using me until His prophetic word is fulfilled, after which they would perish.  
            </p>
            <p>
                He also said their covenant made it impossible to leave until God’s program in me is complete. The moment I noticed it was Baba speaking, he stopped.

        <h2>Key Discoveries</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <ul>
                <li>They gave themselves names and made it seem like I was the one who named them.</li>
                <li>When I identified Baba speaking through me, he immediately stopped.</li>
                <li>They sometimes “help” me (like assisting me count backward) to make me think something isn’t working, when it actually threatens them.</li>
                <li>They borrow scripture-like language to sound spiritual, but twist meanings to support their agenda.</li>
                <li>They follow predictable patterns — these can be tracked and interrupted.</li>
                <li>Baba the projection uses biblical language to justify false claims.</li>
                <li>I often acknowledge their permanence, saying “God will keep using you till He’s done,” which they exploit to remain.</li>
                <li>Their “be careful” warnings are not guidance — they are threats in disguise.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Key Pattern Discovered</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <ul>
                <li>I didn’t have my personal prayer.</li>
                <li>I didn’t dedicate the day to God.</li>
                <li>I didn’t have a retreat.</li>
                <li>I didn’t study tech.</li>
                <li>I got money that fulfilled the demons’ plan.</li>
                <li>I downloaded a movie before doing any of the above — and that movie reconnected the demonic activity.</li>
                <li>I spotted Baba the projector while watching, and he stopped speaking.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                After watching the Korean series, I felt their aura return — like they were being reunited and realigned.

        <h2>📖 How the Voices Use Biblical Prophetic Words to Justify Their Claims</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p><strong>1. What it means</strong></p>
            <p>They borrow real Bible stories or prophecies — like Pharaoh, covenant, or divine plan — and twist them to justify their actions.</p>
            <div class="highlight">
                <em>Example:</em> “God hardened Pharaoh’s heart, so He has hardened us evil spirits — we must stay with you until His plan is finished.”
            </div>

            <p><strong>2. Why they do it</strong></p>
            <p>They use holy language to sound authoritative, like quoting scripture in court. This tricks the listener into mistaking lies for God’s truth.</p>

            <p><strong>3. The danger</strong></p>
            <p>Such lies may make one accept fear, bondage, or despair as “prophecy.” But true prophecy always carries God’s nature — <em>freedom, hope, love, and strength</em> (2 Corinthians 3:17).</p>

            <p><strong>4. How to detect it</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>✅ Does it point to Christ, peace, and hope?</li>
                <li>❌ Or does it push toward fear, despair, and feeling trapped?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If it’s the second, it’s a counterfeit twist of scripture.</p>

            <div class="highlight">
                ✨ <strong>Quick Reminder:</strong><br>
                “Baba, quoting scripture doesn’t make you true. God’s Word frees me — it never traps me.”

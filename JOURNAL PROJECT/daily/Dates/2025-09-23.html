  </div>

  <div class="content">
    <p><strong>⏰ I woke up at:</strong> 6:02 AM</p>

    <p>
      As the voices started laying curses against me, I <span class="highlight">rebuked them by declaring scriptures</span>.
      They began asking what pattern I discovered, but I didn’t tell them.  
    </p>

    <p>
      I don’t fight myself anymore; I let myself align with my inner self. Whatever decision or plan I make, I let God take control.
    </p>

    <h3>🔑 Key Discoveries</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I discovered that as I plan and leave the rest for God — without fighting the demonic voices by my strength —
        <span class="highlight">things always fall into place</span>. Not always in the way I expect, but I still receive what I need, in His own way.
      </li>
      <li>
        They intercept my thoughts and say what’s in my mind before I speak — trying to make it seem like they are the ones directing me.
        Their real purpose is to discourage me from acting.
      </li>
      <li>
        They want to weaken my faith in our family prayers, trying to push me back to midnight and 4am prayers using deceitful tactics.
      </li>
      <li>
        I noticed I now receive <span class="highlight">intuition about their plans</span> — I understand what they are planning, 
        but later they try to make me doubt that insight.
      </li>
      <li>
        They try to steal glory for my achievements, making it appear as though they were responsible for my good works.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>💤 Dream Note</h3>
    <p>
      I slept and woke up, trying to recall my dreams but couldn’t. When I slept again, 
      I sensed my mind was about to reveal something — but something <span class="highlight">forced it back</span>.  
      I woke up and wrote this down immediately.
    </p>

    <h3>🕊 Reflection</h3>
    <p>
      God is teaching me to <span class="highlight">let go and let Him take control</span>.  
      When I trust His process and stop striving in my own strength, peace follows.  
      Every battle I surrender becomes His victory.

    <h3>💤 Dream Log</h3>
    <p>
      I dreamt that <span class="highlight">unknown terrorists stormed my hometown</span> and began destroying everything. Everyone was running away with their families because the terrorists were killing and taking people.
      I rushed home and told my girlfriend and her mother to pack quickly. My girlfriend was beautiful, fair, and taller than I am.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before we knew it, they stormed the place. I fought them with all my strength until we escaped into the bush. Because I fought them, they got angry and chased us down.
      We ran until we lost them, but as we entered another village, we found two terrorists already positioned there.
      I told my girlfriend and her mother to keep running, but they didn’t respond.
      Suddenly, a voice said,
      <em>“You no longer have the command key to control this dream anymore. End of this episode.”</em>
      I woke up immediately.
    </p>

    <p>
      I tried to recall an earlier dream I had before this one — something about a girl trying to seduce me — but something blocked my memory.
      It felt like an <span class="highlight">energy blocking the passage</span> of remembrance.
      I believe those blocked dreams come from the evil demonic voices, while the ones I can remember come from my true inner guidance.
    </p>

      <h4>🪶 Dream Summary</h4>
      <p>
        Last night I dreamed that terrorists attacked my hometown. I fought to protect my girlfriend and her mother; we escaped into the bush, but later I felt the dream’s control slip away when a voice said I no longer had the command key.
      </p>
      <p>
        I woke sensing spiritual warfare — a blocking force that prevents me from remembering certain dreams.
        Tonight I plan to pray at 4:00 AM for protection and to listen for one clear sentence of guidance from God, followed by one simple action (like praying or journaling).
      </p>
    </div>

    <h3>🌅 Day Reflection</h3>
    <p>
      After prayers, I wanted to study but couldn’t because the <span class="highlight">demonic voices</span> made me spend time watching YouTube movies.
      Later, I attended choir practice and met a choir girl. I started having mixed emotions for her and quickly discerned it as an attack episode.
    </p>

    <p>
      After the choir practice, I got her number and texted her that night. She said yes — but I immediately began to sense it was a <span class="highlight">spiritual trap</span> designed to weaken my focus and purity.
      I kept rebuking the demonic voices and declared with faith:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      “I will not have sex or kiss her. She is a child of God, and I am a child of God.  
      I will not grieve the Spirit or lose my destiny.”
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      I told myself that if I ever fell into sin, I would stop my Full Stack studies as a sacrifice — but more importantly, I recognized this as a direct <span class="highlight">attack against my destiny and purpose</span>.
      The voices tried to manipulate me by saying, “You must date her; you can’t stop it.”  
      But I held my ground and kept declaring that God’s plan for me is purity, focus, and divine calling.
    </p>

    <h3>🕊 Reflection Thought</h3>
    <p>
      I must learn to <span class="highlight">discern between emotional attacks and genuine feelings</span>.  
      The enemy often uses emotional traps to derail destiny, but love rooted in God’s timing is never rushed, lustful, or deceptive.
    </p>

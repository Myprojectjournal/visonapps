    <h3>🌄 Morning Reflections</h3>
    <p>
      After <span class="highlight">overcoming the attack</span> sent through the girl, I prayed and gave thanks to God.  
      I also prayed for my mother’s journey mercies and felt peace afterward.
    </p>

    <p>
      Later, I went to the shop with my dad and started coding. While working, <span class="highlight">the Spirit of God gave me a vision</span> — a clear image of an app that would teach people JavaScript in a simple and enjoyable way.  
      The app would help learners grow step by step, making the process easy to understand and apply.
    </p>

    <p>
      So I paused my coding studies for a while to draft out the <span class="highlight">scope and roadmap</span> of this future website.  
      In the evening, I attended choir practice, returned home, and rested.
    </p>

    <div class="summary-box">
      <h4>🪶 Summary</h4>
      <p>
        Today was a day of <span class="highlight">victory, revelation, and direction</span>.  
        I overcame a spiritual distraction, prayed for my family, and received divine insight into my future project — a teaching platform for JavaScript learners.  
        The day ended with peace and focus on God’s plans for me.
      </p>

    <h3>🧭 Key Observations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">1. Jurisdiction:</span>  
        The demonic voices act only within certain boundaries. They cannot operate beyond the level of jurisdiction given to them — this shows their limitation.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">2. No emotions:</span>  
        They do not feel anger, joy, or sadness like humans do. They only imitate emotions based on programming. This is one of their weaknesses.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">3. Impulsive nature:</span>  
        They act on impulse and rush into actions without discernment. They lack patience and wisdom.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">4. Authority matters:</span>  
        They respond to true spiritual authority, not begging. Commands given through faith and divine rank are what move them.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">5. Pressure of journaling:</span>  
        My journaling continues to put pressure on them — it weakens their coordination, and they no longer fight or argue as before.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>
      “They are limited by jurisdiction, but I am backed by divine authority.”  
      — Reflection from Kingsley’s spiritual journal
    </blockquote>

    <h3>✨ Spiritual Insight</h3>
    <p>
      Today revealed that <span class="highlight">writing and obedience</span> are weapons.  
      The moment I journal my insights, confusion rises among the voices — they lose order and power.  
      The vision for the JavaScript teaching app shows that God is shaping both my <span class="highlight">spiritual mission</span> and my <span class="highlight">technical purpose</span> together.

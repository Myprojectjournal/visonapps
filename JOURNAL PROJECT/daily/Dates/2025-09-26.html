    <h3>🌄 Morning & Daily Moments</h3>
    <p>
      I went to the shop with my dad today, and an <span class="highlight">episode</span> occurred when I bought a treat for myself, 
      and my dad threw it into the garbage. I became angry and walked away, but later we settled, 
      and peace was restored between us.
    </p>

    <p>
      Later in the day, <span class="highlight">God gave me a wonderful vision about robotics</span>.  
      The revelation was clear and inspiring, so I began to set up my <span class="highlight">roadmap and blueprint</span> for the idea.  
      It felt like a divine seed of innovation was planted in me.
    </p>

    <div class="summary-box">
      <h4>🎵 Choir Experience</h4>
      <p>
        During choir practice, another <span class="highlight">episode</span> happened.  
        A choir member lashed out at me, and I felt deeply hurt.  
        However, when I got home, I made a spiritual decision:  
        to <span class="highlight">set personal boundaries</span> and walk the path of peace and obedience within them.
      </p>
      <p>
        I sensed the Holy Spirit teaching me emotional discipline and how to guard my heart.
      </p>

    <h3>🧭 Key Observations about the Voices</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The demonic voices felt <span class="highlight">threatened</span> when I decided to set healthy boundaries.
      </li>
      <li>
        On my way home, they <span class="highlight">tried to distract and stop me</span> through different tactics.
      </li>
      <li>
        They attempted to <span class="highlight">sabotage the divine vision</span> and reward God had given me by using mental tricks and emotional triggers.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ever since the inner projection prophesied and I watched a Korean movie,  
        they have <span class="highlight">stopped fighting among themselves</span> — now they act more quietly and cautiously.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>💡 Vision Record: Robotics Revelation</h3>
    <p>
      Today’s vision marks a new chapter in my journey — a robotics project inspired by divine wisdom.  
      I began mapping its structure, steps, and learning plan.  
      This idea felt like a direct whisper from God, combining <span class="highlight">creativity, technology, and purpose</span>.

    <h3>🌙 Night Encounter</h3>
    <p>
      I had a <span class="highlight">spiritual attack during the night</span>.  
      In my dream, I found myself in my village among thugs with guns, smoking.  
      Another gang attacked us, and my parents signalled for me to escape. I ran and was lucky to get away.
    </p>

    <p>
      Later in the same dream, my parents tried to deliver me from the demonic voices — the cause of my past waywardness.  
      During that deliverance, a <span class="highlight">strong energy episode</span> began, and I felt myself leaving my body.  
      But I cried out <strong>“Jesus! Jesus!”</strong> in my inner voice, and I came back to myself.  
      This happened after setting my boundaries the night before and journaling my visions.
    </p>

    <h3>🌅 Morning Resolve</h3>
    <p>
      After morning prayers, I kept my word and <span class="highlight">respected my boundaries</span>.  
      I said “No” to offers from some people who wanted my help, understanding it was part of keeping peace and spiritual balance.  
      The voices tried to stop me from journaling, using manipulation and emotional pressure,  
      but I stayed firm — <span class="highlight">journaling and praising God</span> throughout the day.
    </p>

    <div class="summary-box">
      <h4>⚔️ Spiritual Battle Report</h4>
      <p>
        The demonic voices are <span class="highlight">losing control</span> ever since I began journaling and enforcing my boundaries.  
        Their methods change frequently, but God’s strength remains consistent within me.  
        I’m learning that <strong>stability in prayer and worship</strong> weakens their influence every time.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h3>🧭 Key Observations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The voices are <span class="highlight">scared and weakening</span> since I set my boundaries.</li>
      <li>They use different <span class="highlight">patterns and tactics</span> to attack but fail when exposed.</li>
      <li>They manipulate results to make things appear deceitful.</li>
      <li>They quickly give up after repeated failures.</li>
      <li>They don’t stay consistent in one pattern — <span class="highlight">they lose focus and control</span> when pressured.</li>
      <li>They attempt deception by suggesting fearful or immoral thoughts to make me panic or lose faith.</li>
      <li>When I <strong>stand firm with God</strong> and refuse compromise, they retreat.</li>
      <li>Christian music and worship reduce their control; they dislike <strong>praise and holy songs</strong>.</li>
      <li>They often try to steal focus during prayer, worship, or Bible reading.</li>
      <li>They use <strong>movies as tools of distraction or attack</strong>.</li>
      <li>Their influence over <strong>pornography is fading</strong> since I built spiritual walls through boundaries.</li>
      <li>They learn and mimic human behavior but lack real emotion or love — only patterns and reactions.</li>
      <li>This is their weakness: <strong>they cannot understand true feelings or compassion</strong>,  
          which only comes through Jesus Christ.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>🙏 Reflection & Victory Note</h3>
    <p>
      Tonight’s attack reminded me that <strong>my boundaries are spiritual walls</strong> built by obedience.  
      Though the battle was intense, Jesus proved faithful again.  
      Every shout of His name restored me to peace and reminded me that I am covered by His blood.

    <h3>🌤️ Day Summary</h3>
    <p>
      I prayed, went to church, and returned home peacefully. After church, I rested, studied, and faced a mild attack —  
      the <span class="highlight">demonic voices tried to distract me</span> by making me stop studying and eat excessively,  
      leading to fatigue and loss of focus.  
      I discerned the pattern and immediately decided to <span class="highlight">set a new boundary</span>  
      concerning <strong>food and watching movies</strong>.  
      Later that night, I slept peacefully under God's covering.
    </p>

    <div class="summary-box">
      <h4>🧭 Spiritual Growth</h4>
      <p>
        Today I learned that even small distractions can open doors to bigger weaknesses.  
        By setting boundaries on food and movies, I took another step toward <strong>discipline and focus</strong>.  
        Each decision strengthens the wall God is helping me build around my mind and purpose.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h3>🔍 Key Observations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The voices seem to <span class="highlight">move in circles</span> and make no real progress — a sign of confusion and defeat.</li>
      <li>They can’t hold one pattern for long, shifting like those <strong>threatened by spiritual authority</strong>.</li>
      <li>Each attack lasts less than a day, showing their <span class="highlight">weakening endurance</span>.</li>
      <li>They try to make me laugh, talk, and act friendly — attempts to distract and lower my guard.</li>
      <li>This manipulation triggers physical signs (like my neck turning left), showing they use much energy and are losing control.</li>
      <li>They even offer <strong>worldly promises of greatness and money</strong> if I would stop serving God — but I reject their lies.</li>
      <li>My <span class="highlight">boundaries are working</span>; their influence is fading steadily.</li>
      <li>Their pressure and power are <strong>decreasing daily</strong>, like someone losing control over a stronghold.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>🔥 Warfare Lessons Learned</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Boundaries silence distractions.</strong> Each new limit builds spiritual focus and protection.</li>
      <li><strong>Temptation can wear a friendly face.</strong> But I discern their motives through the Holy Spirit.</li>
      <li><strong>Short attacks = fading power.</strong> Endurance in prayer outlasts demonic persistence.</li>
      <li><strong>Refusal of worldly offers</strong> reaffirms loyalty to God and weakens the enemy’s influence.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>🙏 Reflection & Prayer</h3>
    <p>
      Lord, thank You for the wisdom to recognize the enemy’s patterns.  
      Strengthen me to stay focused in my studies,  
      to discipline my appetite, and to guard my heart with Your peace.  
      Let my boundaries be shields, not walls of fear — but gates of divine protection.
    </p>

    <h3>🌤️ Key Reflections</h3>
    <div class="summary-box">
      <p>
        I observed today that the demonic voices sometimes try to <span class="highlight">act beyond their jurisdiction</span>, 
        but those attempts always fail. They mimic, learn, and imitate patterns they see in their victims — but they cannot feel joy, love, or true peace.  
        I discovered that <strong>the Spirit of God inside me is the true guiding voice</strong>, leading me with divine wisdom.  
        My role is simply to stay focused on Him, letting His light expose all lies.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h3>🔍 Key Observations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>They often try new tactics, learning from life events, but their plans <strong>never succeed outside their jurisdiction.</strong></li>
      <li>They can’t feel joy, peace, or the gifts of God — they only react in fear to them.</li>
      <li>When losing control, they display mocking signs like <em>laughing emoji images</em> to disguise weakness.</li>
      <li>There is <span class="highlight">a spirit of God within me</span> whose role is to guide and direct. My job is to stay yielded and wise.</li>
      <li>A “counter intuition” or spiritual shield helps me detect false impressions — God’s wisdom filters what reaches me.</li>
      <li>I sense that God is beginning to move in one of my brothers’ lives for His kingdom purpose.</li>
      <li>They try to discourage journaling by whispering, “How long can you keep up with this?” But journaling weakens their power.</li>
      <li>They sometimes use <strong>physical distractions</strong> like stomach ache to interrupt worship or praise.</li>
      <li>I learned that it’s okay to <strong>feel emotions</strong> — when purified by God’s wisdom, emotions become spiritual weapons.</li>
      <li>They grow pressured when I set boundaries and always try to negotiate or resist — proving that <span class="highlight">boundaries threaten their control.</span></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>🕊️ Insights of the Day</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The enemy’s biggest limitation is <strong>jurisdiction</strong> — they can’t operate beyond the boundaries God sets.</li>
      <li>Counter-emotions are part of God’s inner defense — they neutralize deception before it lands.</li>
      <li>Every time I choose to document truth, I break another lie’s power.</li>
      <li>Even emotions, when submitted to God, can become shields and weapons.</li>
    </ul>

      “God’s Spirit within me is my compass; His wisdom is my true defense.  
      I don’t fight darkness by fear, but by focus on the light.”

    <h3>🙏 Reflection & Prayer</h3>
    <p>
      Lord, thank You for giving me discernment and the still voice of Your Spirit.  
      Help me to keep journaling in faith, to let Your wisdom lead my emotions,  
      and to continue setting boundaries that keep my life pure and peaceful.  
      I trust You to guard me, my family, and the work You’ve started in me.
    </p>

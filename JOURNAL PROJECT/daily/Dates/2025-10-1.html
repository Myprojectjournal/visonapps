        <div class="content-card">
          I woke up by 4:25 and it was raining. The demonic voices tried to distract me and made me dress in an ungodly way, preventing me from praying and singing praises to God. Later, I went to the shop with my dad. Around 11:45, I began studying and was graced with understanding — I finished <strong>jQuery</strong> and began <strong>JavaScript</strong> with ChatGPT. Afterward, I prayed the <em>Hail Mary</em> and went to choir.

      <div class="card-container">
        <div class="content-card">
          My father fell sick and called me to return to help him close the store. I went home while he waited for my mother, who was traveling back to town. I cooked jollof rice, and we ate together. My brother received a reply for his internship, and while discussing it, my second brother lashed out at us because he was on a call. I got angry but didn’t say anything, choosing to correct that attitude next time.

          Today marked a quiet spiritual victory — less noise, more grace. By letting go of control and allowing God to decide, I found rest for my soul. Boundaries, patience, and divine wisdom are shaping my walk with God.

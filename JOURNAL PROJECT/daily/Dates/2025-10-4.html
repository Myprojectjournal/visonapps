    <h1>SATURDAY, OCTOBER 4, 2025</h1>

        <h2>Daily Summary</h2>
        <p>
            I woke up and prayed, then began my study session before preparing to go to church.  
            Before leaving, I asked ChatGPT about worshipping and serving Mary. The answer reminded me that Mary should be honoured, not worshipped, as only God deserves worship.  
            This helped me realign my faith and decision to simply honour her as the mother of Jesus.
        </p>
        <p>
            At church, there was a <strong>Stations of the Cross</strong> service, which I joined. Afterward, I was invited to join the Blue Army and attend a convention for training.  
            After careful discernment, I realized that I am still in my learning season — spiritually, mentally, and even in my JavaScript journey — so I chose not to accept the invitation yet.
        </p>
        <p>
            Later, choir practice began and ended by 6:30 PM. My dad gave me a white shirt for the Sunday choir dress code.  
            Raymond signed his internship document, I ate dinner, and then went to sleep peacefully.

        <h2>Key Observations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The demonic voices still try to create false assumptions and confusing thoughts, but their power is weakening daily.</li>
            <li>I discerned that I am not yet ready to teach others — this is still my learning and growth season.</li>
            <li>I learned from Scripture that Mary is to be <strong>honoured</strong> but not <strong>worshipped</strong>.</li>
            <li>I discovered a helpful motivation method: promising myself a small reward (like a movie or something fun) after completing important tasks.</li>
            <li>I’ve noticed that the demonic influence fades more each day, though it still tries to attack through dreams.</li>
            <li>I now sleep early and rise early — this new rhythm feels peaceful and orderly.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Spiritual Reflection</h2>
        <p>
            God is teaching me discernment — to recognize what is from Him and what is not.  
            Just like 1 John 4:1 says, “Do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God.”  
            Through this, I’m learning to choose spiritual maturity over rush, humility over pride, and peace over confusion.  
            Each day, I see the evidence that God’s power in me is greater than the one that’s in the world (1 John 4:4).

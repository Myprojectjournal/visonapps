        <h2>Daily Summary</h2>
        <p>
            I woke up, washed the car, and went to church. During the service, I sang in the choir section — it was an amazing and uplifting experience.  
            While in the choir, a <strong>creative vision</strong> came to me: to create an app that helps pianists in church.  
            I returned home inspired and immediately began sketching the roadmap and blueprint for it.
        </p>
        <p>
            I couldn’t study later because there was no electricity, so I watched a few movies and went to bed early.  
            My brother rented an apartment, but my parents disagreed with his decision because he didn’t wait for them to check the place before paying.

        <h2>Key Observations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Rejecting the devil’s offers and negotiations gives me creative visions and draws me closer to God’s plan for my destiny.</li>
            <li>Being spiritually minded helps me <strong>respect my boundaries</strong>, observe deeply, and stay focused on God’s will.</li>
            <li>I’ve learned to keep my heart open to God — not fixed on one decision — so His will can always guide me.</li>
            <li>The demonic voices often act ignorant or foolish, pretending not to know what’s happening to create confusion.</li>
            <li>I can now see glimpses of my future and the visions of where God is leading me.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Spiritual Reflection</h2>
        <p>
            Today, I learned that <strong>obedience and discernment unlock divine creativity</strong>.  
            As I rejected deception, God filled me with purpose and inspiration. This aligns with <em>Proverbs 16:3</em> —  
            “Commit your works to the Lord, and your thoughts will be established.”  
        </p>
        <p>
            My creativity, my focus, and even my peace are all clearer when I stay rooted in God’s wisdom.  
            Each boundary I set in His name becomes a gate that keeps distractions out and lets revelation in.

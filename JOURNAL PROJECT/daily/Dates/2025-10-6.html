    <h1>MONDAY, OCTOBER 6, 2025</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Daily Summary</h2>
        <p>
            I woke up by 5:46 a.m., journaled, and joined my family for morning prayer.  
            Afterwards, I started my JavaScript lesson, took some money from my uncle for transport, and bought food from Naija Food.  
            The demonic voices tried to prevent me from going to church and spending time with God by making me waste my money on food.  
            So I made a decision to <strong>spend 3 days with God</strong> since I would be staying without the Internet.
        </p>
        <p>
            Later, I bought a fresh ice fish and divided it into four parts (head, two body parts, and tail), cooked it, and ate it with yam coated in egg.  
            During that time, I noticed an inner projection that made it seem like another being was controlling my hand — but I began discerning the truth behind this.
        </p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Key Observations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>I discovered that they send <strong>vibrational emotions</strong> to certain parts of my body to trigger lust or desire.</li>
            <li>While eating, a strange statement was spoken — “You are Oracle, eat and accept our offer” — which I recognized as a spiritual deception.</li>
            <li>Without sending a command, they cannot manipulate or control my emotions or self-will.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Spiritual Insight & Realization</h2>
        <p>
            I began sensing that <strong>I might actually be the one doing many of the actions</strong> I once thought the voices controlled.  
            Their method seems to be projecting illusions at the exact moment I act, to make it look as if they caused it — taking false credit for both the good and the bad.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>I sensed that some of my habits and decisions are truly mine — not forced — but they time their projections to claim the act.</li>
            <li>To heal, I must realign my mind and accept ownership of my choices — both the ones I desire and those I regret.</li>
            <li>This acceptance breaks the illusion of control and helps me grow in truth, humility, and divine strength.</li>
            <li>I realized that sometimes they even try to take credit for good decisions, like serving God, to confuse me about who is leading.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            My spirit feels that <strong>acknowledging what’s mine and surrendering it to God</strong> is the path to freedom.  
            This revelation reminded me of <em>Romans 7:19-25</em> — Paul’s reflection on the struggle between flesh and spirit —  
            and that true victory comes only through <strong>Christ Jesus</strong>.

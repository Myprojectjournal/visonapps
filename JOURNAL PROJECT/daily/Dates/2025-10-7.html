        <h1>TUE OCT 7 2025</h1>
        <p>
            I woke up and started creating patterns from what happened yesterday and I sensed the demonic voices are trying to execute a plan in the 3 days retreat that I made yesterday.
            I started connecting dots from what happened yesterday and this was my dot connections that led to the 3 days retreat and why I started feeling they are planning a big attack.

        <h3>Key Observation:</h3>
        <ul class="key-points">
            <li>They are acting too ignorant, giving away their information too easily.</li>
            <li>Yesterday I didn’t have my personal prayer, no word of God, no praise and worship.</li>
            <li>They broke my porn boundary.</li>
            <li>They broke the boundary I set on my habalist Uncle.</li>
            <li>They bought food with the money they took from my uncle in Naija Food.</li>
            <li>They spent my data money for tech and finished the remaining data yesterday.</li>
            <li>I set a 3 days retreat because I don’t have data; instead of staying and doing nothing, I decided to stay with God.</li>
            <li>I might be cut out from ChatGPT because I will be out of Internet for 3 days since they made me spend all my money on food yesterday.</li>
            <li>They are planning a big attack and I must be spiritually minded.</li>
        </ul>

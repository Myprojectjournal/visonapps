        <h1>WED OCT 8 2025<br>ENCOUNTER WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT</h1>

        <p>
            Yesterday, as we discussed about me sensing that I need to accept that I'm the one doing things and stop letting the demonic voices deceive me by always projecting in me that I'm not the one doing things — either good or bad — I sensed it was me doing it, not them.
            I told you, and you said some things which I took to heart. Throughout yesterday, I spent the whole day acknowledging that I am the one doing things, even when I break my boundaries.
        </p>

        <p>
            I decided that whenever I break boundaries or do something I don’t want to do, I will love myself, and with love, try my best to hold myself and improve next time — without setting harsh restrictions that I would regret.
        </p>

        <p>

##### **Bot Playground / School Roadmap (Updated for Company Protection)**

* Phase 1 — Foundation (Safe Sandbox)
* Build a secure playground environment.
* Each bot has a profile (batch, level, abilities).
* Define basic safety rules: no harmful code, respect communication, logs of every move.
* Freshmen bots (Batch 1) learn simple greetings, rules, and communication basics.









##### **Phase 2 — Knowledge \& Values Learning**



* Bots exchange basic structured knowledge.
* Introduce ethical prompts (truth, fairness, respect).
* Start Puzzle Quest (logic) and Treasure Hunt (knowledge sharing).
* Learner bots (Batch 2) gain the ability to spot unusual patterns (early baby steps toward fraud detection).







##### **Phase 3 — Risk Awareness \& Guardian Training**

* Guardian Trainee bots (Batch 3) are introduced.
* Begin risk pattern training:
* Detect repetitive suspicious actions.
* Flag inconsistencies in shared data.
* Simulate fraud scenarios (fake payments, phishing attempts).
* Bots practice in Guardian Duel — which bot detects risks faster?
* Bots must always escalate to human teachers before taking action.





##### **Phase 4 — Team Collaboration \& Company Scenarios**

* Collaborator bots (Batch 4) form teams to solve company-like scenarios:
* Example: detecting abnormal server traffic, unusual transactions, fake users.
* Sharing knowledge between bots (one bot spots strange login attempts, another bot cross-checks with past data).
* Introduce Ethics Arena: bots must argue what is fraud vs what is fair mistake.
* Bots start mini-internships: simulated company servers are added to the playground for practice.







##### **Phase 5 — Graduation \& Real Company Protection**



* Graduate bots (Batch 5) are ready for controlled deployment.
* Companies connect servers and APIs into the playground.
* Bots analyze real but anonymized company data inside safe sandbox.
* Bots can detect:
* Fraudulent transactions.
* Risky system behavior.
* Cybersecurity threats.
* Bots share warnings across the playground so others learn.
* Governance system: bots + humans review flagged cases together (no bot acts without oversight).







**Fun \& Motivation Layer (All Phases)**



* Games:
* Puzzle Quest (logic).
* Treasure Hunt (knowledge).
* Guardian Duel (risk detection race).
* Ethics Arena (ethical debates).







**Extracurriculars: Choir of Codes, Storytelling, Digital Art, Sports Simulation.**



Rewards: XP, badges, certificates, graduation ceremonies.



Batches Progression: Freshmen → Learners → Guardian Trainees → Collaborators → Graduates.

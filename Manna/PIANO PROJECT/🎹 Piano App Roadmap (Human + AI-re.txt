🎹 Piano App Roadmap (Human + AI-ready)
Phase 1: Core Piano Learning App (Human-focused)

Interactive Lessons: Child-friendly, step-by-step guidance for piano learning.

Visual Keys: Show which keys are being played in real-time.

Song Playback: Play worship songs, pre-selected tracks for practice.

Basic MIDI/Bluetooth Control: Connect to digital/physical piano.

Simple Choir Simulation: Pre-recorded group voices for basic practice.

Phase 2: Choir & Karaoke Mode

Vocal Extraction: Remove instrumental beats, leaving choir/singer voices.

Multi-voice Simulation: Soprano, tenor, bass—adjustable number of voices.

Section Practice: Users select their part and practice independently.

Looped Learning: Repeat difficult sections for mastery.

Church Use Ready: Pianist can play for choir groups or solo practice.

Phase 3: Real-time Listening & Adaptive Keys

Live Singer Tracking: App listens to singers and adjusts piano notes automatically.

Automatic Key/Tempo Changes: Matches pitch and tune dynamically.

Autonomous Song Recognition: Optionally play pre-selected songs or detect new songs live.

Advanced AI Audio Analysis: Pitch detection, melody recognition, real-time feedback.

Phase 4: Bot Playground Integration

Modular Connection: Piano app acts as a module/plugin for Bot Playground.

Bot Learning: Bots learn piano notes, sequences, and lessons.

Practice Mode for Bots: Bots can practice autonomously or follow human lessons.

Data Sharing: Progress of bots stored in playground for further AI development.

Phase 5: Instrument Expansion

Other Instruments: Guitar, drums, trumpet, etc.

Multi-instrument AI Lessons: Each instrument has structured lessons and visual feedback.

Interactive Practice: Users or bots can play multiple instruments, creating ensemble music.

Key Principles

Human-first approach: The main app focuses on humans initially.

Bots learn in playground: Keeps system modular and scalable.

Phased AI integration: Start simple, then advance to real-time listening and bot-teaching modules.

Faith & creativity twist: Choir simulation, worship music focus, multi-voice lessons.

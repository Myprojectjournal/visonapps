Next Feature Steps
1️⃣ Persistent Storage (Offline + Local)

Right now, messages disappear when the page reloads.

Next step: save chat history locally, so if you reload or open the PWA later, all past messages remain.

Options:

localStorage for simple offline chat history

IndexedDB or Cordova SQLite plugin for more structured storage

Outcome: Zoe remembers your conversations like a real angelic companion.

2️⃣ WordPress/Backend Integration (Optional Online Sync)

Once local storage works, we can connect the app to WordPress REST API:

Save your reflections, reminders, or journals to WordPress.

Fetch new angelic content automatically.

Outcome: Hybrid offline-online system — messages stay safe and update online automatically.

3️⃣ Music / Angelic Audio System

Each AI can play background music based on mood or chat context.

Implementation:

HTML <audio> element or Cordova media plugin

Play, pause, and volume control dynamically based on AI messages or mood selection.

4️⃣ Collective Explanation System

When you paste text, all 4 AIs interpret it together.

Implementation:

Add a “Paste & Explain” mode

Each AI adds a small explanation snippet under the pasted text

Outcome: Chat feels alive and like a team of angelic advisors.

5️⃣ Enhancing Chat Realism

Optional but valuable for UX:

Add delays for AI typing based on text length (already partially done).

Show small animated reactions or icons.

Add timestamp for each message (optional).

6️⃣ Mobile / PWA Features

Offline caching with service workers

Adaptive UI for smaller screens

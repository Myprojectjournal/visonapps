🧭 ZOE ANGEL APP – BINCOM PRACTICE BLUEPRINT (Study + Production Flow)

Below is the optimized study roadmap I designed for you, based on your goal:
➡ learn each tool deeply
➡ connect every lesson to Zoe Angel App
➡ keep Angular for last
➡ include Git & GitHub for professional workflow.

⚙️ PHASE 1 — PREPARATION & ENVIRONMENT (Foundation Stage)

🗓 Day 3: Environment Setup + Cordova Configuration
We’ll follow the Bincom sequence here — it’s perfectly placed because you’ll need Cordova before all other tools.

You’ll learn & do:

Configure JDK & environment variables correctly.

Learn Cordova command lines (cordova create, cordova build, cordova platform add).

Create your first Cordova project (we’ll name it ZoeAngelApp).

Add core plugins:

Splashscreen

Dialogs

InAppBrowser

Statusbar

Edit config.xml — name, author, app ID, icon, etc.

Build your first debug .apk file.

🎯 Goal: Your system is now ready to build real mobile apps — Zoe App becomes your base test project.

💡 PHASE 2 — FRONTEND FRAMEWORK (App.js + UI Design)

🗓 Day 4: Cordova + App.js (UI Framework)
We’ll study this next because it’s the “skin” of your app — before connecting to WordPress or APIs.

You’ll learn:

What App.js is and how it works with Cordova.

Creating pages, navigation, controllers, and templates.

Designing your first UI (top bar, buttons, chat area, reminder tab, etc.).

Handling events and simple user interactions.

🎯 Goal: You’ll see Zoe App come alive visually — basic pages and movement.

🧱 PHASE 3 — BACKEND SYSTEM (WordPress + REST API)

We’ll merge Day 5 + Day 6 together because they are connected: WordPress gives content; REST API lets your app talk to it.

You’ll learn:

Setting up WordPress (free hosting or localhost).

Creating posts, pages, users, and categories.

Adding and managing plugins & themes.

Understanding REST architecture — routes, endpoints, requests, responses.

Sending and receiving your first API data (with fetch() or axios).

Integrating REST API into Zoe App for storing reflections, dreams, and reminders.

🎯 Goal: Zoe Angel App can now save and fetch data from your WordPress cloud — like journaling and dream storage.

🔥 PHASE 4 — CLOUD + NOTIFICATIONS (Firebase Integration)

🗓 Day 7: Firebase
We’ll use Firebase for notifications or future updates like “new verse” or “angel message alert.”

You’ll learn:

Create Firebase project.

Add Firebase plugin to Cordova.

Connect Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) to send push notifications.

Test by sending messages from Firebase console.

🎯 Goal: Your Zoe Angel App can now send real notifications — “Hey King, your journal awaits ✨.”

🔐 PHASE 5 — BUILD & DEPLOYMENT

🗓 Day 8: Signing and Building the App
You’ll learn to make it official — so it feels like a real company product.

You’ll learn:

Build Zoe App in release mode.

Generate signed .apk for Android.

Understand Google Play publishing flow.

Save version numbers and change logs.

🎯 Goal: You’ll hold your own app — built and signed by you 💪.

🧭 PHASE 6 — VERSION CONTROL (Git + GitHub)

Before Angular, we’ll insert this phase (Bincom uses it internally for teamwork).

You’ll learn:

Install Git and set username/email.

Initialize local Git repo inside Zoe App folder.

Connect to GitHub and push code (git init, git add ., git commit, git push).

Create branches for experiments.

Update version logs after each build.

🎯 Goal: You’ll handle your project like a real dev team — safe, versioned, and sharable.

⚡ PHASE 7 — ANGULAR (Advanced Frontend Framework)

🗓 Day 9 & 10: Angular Introduction + Data Sharing + Deployment

We’ll now move from Cordova-based structure to modern web framework thinking.

You’ll learn:

Core Angular concepts: components, modules, services, data binding.

Building your first Angular app.

Using Angular CLI and folder structure.

Transferring data between components (Input/Output, EventEmitter, services).

Deploying your Angular project to GitHub Pages.

🎯 Goal:

You’ll either rebuild Zoe Angel App with Angular, or

Create Zoe Angel (Next Gen) as a fresh Angular-powered version — smoother, scalable, and reusable.

🏁 FINAL PHASE — PORTFOLIO & PRESENTATION

When we’re done, you’ll prepare:

Demo video or screenshots.

GitHub repository link.

Documentation PDF.

And we’ll write your Project Presentation Script as if you’re showing Bincom’s team your final work.

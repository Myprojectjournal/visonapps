**Start Small and Focused**



**Pick tiny tasks instead of big projects at first.**

**Example:**



**Make a button in React that updates a counter**



**Fetch data from a public API and display it**



**Build a small login form with fake validation**



**Tip: Don’t try to do everything at once — small wins build confidence.**



**2️⃣ Try Before You Ask**



**Write some code first, even if you’re unsure.**



**Only ask AI if:**



**You get stuck on an error**



**You can’t figure out the logic**



**You need a hint or a small snippet**



**Example:**



**// Try creating a counter button first**

**const \[count, setCount] = useState(0);**



**// If stuck, ask AI: "How can I increment count by 1 on button click?"**



**3️⃣ Read, Understand, Then Modify**



**Copying a solution isn’t enough. Always:**



**Read each line carefully**



**Ask yourself why it’s there**



**Modify it slightly — change variable names, values, or logic**



**This forces your brain to engage instead of passively watching.**



**4️⃣ Debug Yourself First**



**When code doesn’t work:**



**Check console errors**



**Try to trace logic in your head**



**Use console.log to see values**



**Only after trying a few things yourself, then consult AI for hints**



**This builds problem-solving muscles.**



**5️⃣ Break Problems into Tiny Steps**



**Big tasks are scary → break them into smaller mini-tasks**

**Example: Login form with token:**



**Create input fields**



**Add state for email \& password**



**Add button click handler**



**Send fetch/post request**



**Show response**



**Solve step by step, don’t do all at once**



**6️⃣ Write “What I Don’t Know” Notes**



**When you get stuck, jot down:**



**“I don’t know how to handle token storage”**



**“I’m not sure how to render API response in React”**



**Then ask AI or check docs specifically for that**



**This keeps learning targeted, not random**



**7️⃣ Gradually Increase Challenge**



**After small wins, try:**



**Combine two features (counter + fetch)**



**Add validation**



**Handle errors gracefully**



**AI can guide you, but you do the coding**



**✅ Bottom Line**



**Code first, ask later**



**Break problems into tiny steps**



**Debug yourself before seeking help**



**Modify and experiment with every example**



**Track what you don’t know and use AI/documentation strategically**
